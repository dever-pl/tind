Description: Provides an easy-to-use tind class representing time indices
    of different types (years, quarters, months, ISO 8601 weeks, dates,
    time of day, date-time, and arbitrary integer/numeric indices).
    Includes an extensive collection of functions for calendrical computations
    (including business applications), index conversions, index parsing,
    and other operations. Auxiliary classes representing time differences and
    time intervals (with set operations and index matching functionality) are
    also provided. All routines have been optimised for speed in order
    to facilitate computations on large datasets. More details regarding
    calendars in general and calendrical algorithms can be found in
    "Calendar FAQ" by Claus Tøndering <https://www.tondering.dk/claus/calendar.html>.
